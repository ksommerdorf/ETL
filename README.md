# Overview of Project
Amazing Prime Video, a platform for streaming movies and TV shows on Amazing Prime, is sponsoring a hackathon. Britta, a member of the Amazing Prime Video team, has asked for help cleaning movie data in order to predict the popular pictures for the hackathon. The prediction will then help Amazing Prime Video develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies that are being released will become popular so that they can buy the streaming rights at a bargain. An automated pipeline was created for Britta that takes in the new data from Kaggle metadata, Wikipedia data, and MovieLens rating data. The automated pipeline then performs the appropriate transformations and loads the data into existing tables in a PostgreSQL database.
